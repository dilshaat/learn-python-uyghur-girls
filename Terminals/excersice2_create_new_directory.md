# Creating new Directory

## MacOS

1. Create new directory named `Folder1` in current position:

```bash
mkdir Folder1
```
2. Create a new directory named `Folder2` in parent directory:
```bash
mkdir ../Folder2
```

3.Create a new directory named `Folder3` in `root`:
```bash
mkdir /Folder3 
```
> So `mkdir` takes a name if you want to create a folder in current location, or it takes either `absolute path` or `relative path` if you want to create a folder in a specific location.

## Windows 

> In `Windows Powershell` it is the same except for the path you provide. You just need to replace the path above with `Windows` paths.
