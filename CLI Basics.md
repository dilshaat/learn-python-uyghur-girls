## Navigation

`cd` is the command to navigate through the **File System**. `cd` stands for *Change Directory* and it will allow you to change your location from on directory to another back and forth. `cd` command expects you to provide a **PATH** to navigate into. `cd` is a command in *Linux* and *MacOS*, it is an *Alias* in *Windows PowerShell* for `Get-Location`.

There are a few charactor symobls that represents certain directories in the File System. 
* The tilde:  `~`
* The single dot:  `.`
* The double dot:  `..`

and 

* `~` stands for current user's **home directoy**.
* `.` stands for current directory
* `..` stands for parent directory

## Creating Directory or Folders

To create a directory use `mkdir` command in all *Windows*, *Linux/Unix* or *MacOS* by supplying absolute or relative path, for example:

>$ mkdir /Users/dilshad/Desktop/MyProjects
```
